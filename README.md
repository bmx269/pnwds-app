# Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit 2017 Session App

This application is for use as a proof of concept, using decoupled Drupal 8 as an API server, and an Ember.js app as the frontend. The challenge with the app is that it will be built in under 30 days, on spare time. This is to show the viablility of creating an app for rapid prototyping with Drupal and Ember.js.

*This app will be online before Feb 25th, 2017.*
